# This is a demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shawnpetros/reactRIQ.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shawnpetros/reactRIQ)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a React implementation of [Chris Hogan's RIQ calculator](https://www.chrishogan360.com/riq-tool/).

Demo [here](https://arashcuzi.github.io/reactRIQ) or [here](http://calc.shawnpetros.com).

It will hopefully implement much of the same functionality and similar look and feel (there are many cool UI features to recreate).

I am putting this up as a side project and to showcase my work and interest in not only working for a company like Ramsey Solutions, but also my interest in Finance and my skills as a JavaScript developer.
